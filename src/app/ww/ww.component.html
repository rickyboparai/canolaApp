    <h2>WHEN AND WHERE TO USE THE APP</h2>
    <p>This sclerotinia risk App is developed for canola grown in the three Prairie Provinces of Canada, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Automatic, real time and location specific rainfall data is only available between April 1 and September 1 each year. However, the App is functional anytime by entering a canola flowering stage and rainfall data manually.</p>
